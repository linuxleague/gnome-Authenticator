# Hey newcomer, welcome to Authenticator

The application is built using Rust, GTK 4, GLib and other GNOME technologies around it. It's built to run on either desktop or mobile.

## If you're a translator

You can translate Authenticator here: <https://l10n.gnome.org/module/authenticator/>

## If you're a developer

WIP documentation of the internals of the application: <https://world.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/Authenticator/authenticator>

You want to work on fixing a bug, adding a new feature, please first join our Matrix Channel and ask if there is anyone working on that already.
The Matrix Channel: <https://matrix.to/#/#authenticator:gnome.org>

We suggest you to use [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder) as the IDE supports Flatpak and you can hack on Authenticator, click on run and voil√†, you have got to test your modifications without having to think about installing the dependencies or how to build the application itself.

Thanks and good hacking.
