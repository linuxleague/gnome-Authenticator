# Hey newcomer, welcome to Authenticator

The application is built using Python3, Gtk 3, GLib and other GNOME technologies around it. It's built to run on GNOME & Librem 5 phone.

## If you're a translator

## If you're a developer

You want to work on fixing a bug, adding a new feature, please first join our Matrix Channel and ask if there's anyone working on that already.
The Matrix Channel: https://matrix.to/#/#authenticator:matrix.org

We suggest you to use [GNOME Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Builder) as the IDE supports Flatpak and you can hack on Authenticator, click on run and voil√†, you have got to test your modifications without having to think about installing the dependencies or how to build the application itself.

Thanks and good hacking.
